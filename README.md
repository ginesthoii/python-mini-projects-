<h1 align="center">Python Mini Projects</h1>

<br> 

<p align="center">
Tiny, self-contained Python scripts that I built for practice, experiments, and fun. <br>  <br>
Each project lives in its own folder and runs with a single command in the terminal.  <br>  <br>
Think of this repo as my Python sketchbook — quick ideas, simple tools, and little demos that helped me learn by building.

## Notes
- For `qr_generator/` you need `qrcode[pil]` (installed via `requirements.txt`).
- All scripts are stdlib-only except QR and Weather (`requests`)
